debugfs.ocfs2 is a debugging tool for ocfs2 useful for printing on-disk
structures in a readable style.  It performs the same task as debugocfs
does for ocfs1 with one big difference, viz., user interface. debugfs.ocfs2
uses the debugfs (ext2) style.

Currently, apart from being read-only, it does not provide any directory
traversal functionality. What that means is that the user is expected to
provide the inode block number to access any metadata on volume.

"open <device>" opens the device. "stats" shows the super block information.
"ls <blknum>" lists the directory at the block number. "nodes" prints the
list of nodes configured on the device. "cat <blknum>" prints the contents
of the file at that block number. "dump <blknum> <outfile>" copies the contents
of the file into outfile. "logdump <blknum>" prints the contents of the journal
file.

One can either use the interactive mode, i.e., issue commands at a prompt, or
the echo mode. (echo "stats" | debugfs.ocfs2 /dev/sdb1). The echo mode allows
users to redirect the output to a file (very useful when reading the journal
file).

The current list of working commands are as follws:

curdev                          Show current device
open <device>                   Open a device
close                           Close a device
show_super_stats, stats [-h]    Show superblock
show_inode_info, stat <blknum>  Show inode
pwd                             Print working directory
ls <blknum>                     List directory
cat <blknum> [outfile]          Prints or concatenates file to stdout/outfile
dump <blknum> <outfile>         Dumps file to outfile
nodes                           List of nodes
publish                         Publish blocks
vote                            Vote blocks
logdump <blknum>                Prints journal file
help, ?                         This information
quit, q                         Exit the program

As always, comments  are welcome.
