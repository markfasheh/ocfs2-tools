1. Introduction
   ------------
OCFS2 is a general purpose cluster filesystem. Unlike the initial release
of OCFS, which supported only Oracle database workloads, OCFS2 provides
full support as a general purpose filesystem.  OCFS2 is a complete rewrite
of the previous version, designed to work as a seamless addition to the
Linux kernel.

2. Installation
   ------------
If you are using an official OCFS2 release then the only supported
method for installation is from RPM.

2.2. Installing from source
     ======================
You can always get the latest OCFS2 kernel source via the subversion tree:
    http://oss.oracle.com/projects/ocfs2/src/trunk/

Additionally, we provide a set of git tree's to pull from at:
    http://oss.oracle.com/git/ocfs2.git/
    http://oss.oracle.com/git/ocfs2-dev.git/

The ocfs2-dev.git tree can be considered our development tree which is
kept as up to date with the subversion tree as possible. ocfs2.git is
a ready-for-submission tree of clean patch sets.

You'll also want to get the latest ocfs2-tools subversion tree:
    http://oss.oracle.com/projects/ocfs2-tools/src/trunk/

Additionally we make tarballs available at:
    http://oss.oracle.com/projects/ocfs2-tools/files/source/

Installing ocfs2-tools is done via the standard autoconf setup of
"./configure && make && make install". You will likely want to use the
init script provided in vendor/common/o2cb.init - it was written for
SLES9 and RHEL4 but may work on other platforms.

2.2. Installing from RPM
     ===================
Three RPMs are required to install OCFS2. These RPMs can be obtained
from the ocfs2-tools download site,
http://oss.oracle.com/projects/ocfs2-tools/files/

    ocfs2-tools (OCFS2 support tools)
    ocfs2console (GUI Interface)
    ocfs2 (kernel modules). 

'ocfs2-tools' and 'ocfs2console' are generic for each architecture that
OCFS2 supports (x86, ia64, x86_64 or ppc64). The 'ocfs2' package contains
the kernel modules, which must match up exactly with the running kernel 
version (`uname -r` including -smp/-bigsmp/-hugemem/etc.)

The naming convention for these packages is:
  ocfs2console-<VERSION>.<ARCH>.rpm  
  ocfs2tools-<VERSION>.<ARCH>.rpm  
     (e.g.: ocfs2console-0.99.699-1.i386.rpm)
  ocfs2-<KERNEL RELEASE>-<VERSION>.<ARCH>.rpm
     (e.g.: ocfs2-2.6.9-5.EL-0.99.2015-1.i686.rpm)


3. Configuration (/etc/ocfs2/cluster.conf)
   ---------------------------------------
The main configuration file for OCFS2 is '/etc/ocfs2/cluster.conf'.
This file should be the same on all nodes in the cluster, and changes
to this file must be propagated to the other nodes in the cluster. If
a new node is being added to the cluster, all existing nodes must have
their 'cluster.conf' updated BEFORE mounting the ocfs2 partition from
the new node.

OCFS2 provides and strongly recommends generating and editing this file
using 'ocfs2console'. This file can also be created using 'o2cb_ctl'. Refer
to the man pages for more details on these commands.

The configuration file /etc/ocfs2/cluster.conf is in stanza format, with 
one stanza describing the generic cluster attributes and one stanza for 
each node.

3.1. Valid parameters:
     ================

3.1. Valid parameters for the cluster stanza
     =======================================

node_count     - This parameter specifies the number of nodes in the 
cluster. This parameter is exclusive for cluster stanza.

name           - This parameter identifies the name of the cluster.

3.1. Valid parameters for the node stanza
     ====================================

ip_port        - This parameter specifies what IP port will be used by the
OCFS2 cluster stack to communicate to the other nodes.

ip_address     - IP address of the OCFS2 interconnect inteface.

number         - Node number in the cluster. For this parameter, there are
two rules that needs to be followed. The node number has to be unique.

name           - This parameter specifies the name of this node.

cluster        - This is the name of the cluster. Has to match with the name
specified in the cluster stanza.

3.2. /etc/ocfs2/cluster.conf sample:
     ==============================

cluster:
node_count = 3
name = OCFS2CLUSTER

node:
ip_port = 7777
ip_address = 139.185.118.107
number = 0
name = test1
cluster = OCFS2CLUSTER

node:
ip_port = 7777
ip_address = 139.185.118.106
number = 1
name = test2
cluster = OCFS2CLUSTER

3.3. Generate the configuration file.
-------------------------------

3.3.1. Using ocfs2console (GUI) interface.
----------------------------------

OCFS2 also provides a graphical utility for configuring and modifying your
OCFS2 cluster. If your system has the graphical interface enabled, you can
launch 'ocfs2console' to enter the graphical configuration utility.
If X is running as non-root, make sure to enable X authentication to bring
up this utility (this can be done using 'xhost +' or a more secure
variation.  Afer becoming root, make sure to set the environment variable 
DISPLAY to the active X display.

For example:

   myuser:/home/myuser> $ xhost +
   access control disabled, clients can connect from any host
   myuser:/home/myuser> $ su - root
   Password:
   root@localhost> # export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0
   root@localhost> # ocfs2console

When ocfs2console interface opens, proceed with the initial configuration.

3.3.2. Using o2cb_ctl command line Interface.
       -------------------------------------

This not the recommended method for creating the configuration file, but it
can be used by determined users who have read and understood the 'o2cb_ctl'
man page. The entire process must be performed as root.

The example below will show how to create the cluster "mycluster" with two
nodes (node1 and node2).

First, create the cluster:

# o2cb_ctl -C -n mycluster -t cluster -a name=mycluster -a node_count=2

Then, add two nodes:

# o2cb_ctl -C -n node1 -t node -a number=0 -a ip_address=139.185.118.5 \
-a ip_port=7777 -a cluster=mycluster
# o2cb_ctl -C -n node2 -t node -a number=0 -a ip_address=139.185.118.5 \
-a ip_port=7777 -a cluster=mycluster

NOTE: During the initial creation of the configuration file, you should
not make use of the o2cb_ctl parameter "-i" since there is no live
configuration active.

3.4. Starting the OCFS2 Clustering Services
     ======================================

O2CB is the module that provides the clustering services for OCFS2.
It is reponsible for node heartbeat, node management and Distributed
Lock Manager (DLM).

3.4.1. Enabling automatic load on boot.
       ===============================

To enable the automatic load of the O2CB driver on boot, 
execute the following script and answer the prompt. Make sure to enter
the cluster name when asked or the load will fail at boot.

# /etc/init.d/o2cb configure
    Configuring the O2CB driver.

    This will configure the on-boot properties of the O2CB driver.
    The following questions will determine whether the driver is loaded on
    boot.  The current values will be shown in brackets ('[]').  Hitting
    <ENTER> without typing an answer will keep that current value.  Ctrl-C
    will abort.

    Load O2CB driver on boot (y/n) [n]: y
    Cluster to start on boot (Enter "none" to clear) []:
    Writing O2CB configuration: OK

This will configure O2CB to be loaded on boot and will load the ocfs2
modules on the next startup.

3.4.2. Performing manual load.
       ======================

If you don't want to configure O2CB to start on boot and don't want to 
configure a specific cluster to start by default, run the following
commands to startup your ocfs2 cluster.

# /etc/init.d/o2cb load
# /etc/init.d/o2cb online mycluster

This loads the modules and the live configuration of the cluster. This will
not cause OCFS2 to load at boot time.

3.4.3. Stopping O2CB.
       =============

To stop a cluster and unload the modules:

# /etc/init.d/o2cb stop

3.5 If o2cb.init does not work on your platform
    ===========================================

Create your pseudo file system mount points:

# mkdir /config /dlm

Install the modules. Modprobe makes this easy:

# modprobe ocfs2_dlmfs

This will load configfs, ocfs2_nodemanager, ocfs2_dlm, ocfs2_dlmfs.

Mount your configfs file system:
# mount -t configfs none /config

Mount your dlmfs file system:
# mount -t ocfs2_dlmfs none /dlm

Start your cluster (fill in 'CLUSTERNAME'):
# o2cb_ctl -H -n CLUSTERNAME -t cluster -a online=yes

You can now mount your OCFS2 partitions (see step 5)

To stop the OCFS2 cluster services, make sure that all OCFS2
file systems are unmounted and then execute:
# o2cb_ctl -H -n CLUSTERNAME -t cluster -a online=no

4. Creating an OCFS2 partition.
   ---------------------------

Again, all steps here must be performed as root.

Create a new physical partition using fdisk (or parted if it is an ia64 
architecture). There is a minimum size for OCFS2 partitions, to store
metadata and per-node information on disk. To calculate the minimal 
partition size for OCFS, use this formula:

((<#nodes> * <journal size>) + 40Mb) + <user space)

Format the newly created partition using ocfs2console (preferred method)
or mkfs.ocfs2

Below is an example of a device (/dev/sdf1) being formatted to be used to
host database files, in a 3 node cluster. The man pages will have more
information about selecting the best blocksize and cluster size based on
your particular workload. This default is provided as a baseline for 
database workloads.

# mkfs.ocfs2 -b 4096 -C 128k -L DBF1 -N 3 /dev/sdf1

For a filesystem with smaller files, like an ORACLE_HOME or root partition, 
you will want to select a smaller metadata cluster size, as shown here:

# mkfs.ocfs2 -b 4096 -C 4k -L DBF1 -N 3 /dev/sdf1

NOTE: mkfs.ocfs2 will startup the cluster stack to check if the requested
partition is currently in use (and therefore should not be formatted!). 
You can override this behavior by passing the -F flag.

5. Mounting the OCFS2 partition.
   ----------------------------

Once the new partition is properly formatted, the last thing to do is
mount the partition. Before trying to mount, make sure the OCFS2 cluster
services are running (the 'o2cb online' step).

Mount an OCFS2 partition using:

mount -t ocfs2 /dev/sdf1 /oradbf1

Or, add the entries to the /etc/fstab file and issue the command
"mount -a". The entry should be like:

/dev/sdf1 /oradbf1 ocfs2 defaults 0 0

NOTE: The first mount will automatically load the ocfs2 module.
