.SH "NAME"
fsck.ocfs2 \- Check an OCFS2 file system.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBfsck.ocfs2\fR [ \fB\-fGnuvVy\fR ] [ \fB\-b\fR \fIsuperblock block\fR ] [ \fB\-B\fR \fIblock size\fR ] \fIdevice\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP 
\fBfsck.ocfs2\fR is used to check an OCFS2 file system.

\fIdevice\fR is the file where the file system is stored (e.g. \fI/dev/sda1\fR).  It will almost always be a device file but a regular file will work as well.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-b\fR \fIsuperblock block\fR
Normally, \fBfsck.ocfs2\fR will read the superblock from the first block of
the device.  This option specifies an alternate block that the superblock
should be read from.

.TP
\fB\-b\fR \fIblock size\fR
The \fIblock size\fR, specified in bytes, can range from 512 to 4096.  A value of 0, the default, is used to indicate that the blocksize should be automatically detected.

.TP
\fB\-f\fR
Force checking even if the file system is clean.  This currently has no
effect as the file system is always checked.

.TP
\fB\-G\fR
Usually \fBfsck.ocfs2\fR will silently assume inodes whose generation number
does not match the generation number of the super block are unused inodes.
This option causes \fBfsck.ocfs2\fR to ask the user if these inodes should in
fact be marked unused.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR
Give the 'no' answer to all questions that fsck will ask.  This guarantees
that the file system will not be modified and the device will be opened
read-only.  The output of \fBfsck.ocfs2\fR with this option can be redirected
to produce a record of a file system's faults.

.TP
\fB\-y\fR 
Give the 'yes' answer to all questions that fsck will ask.  This will repair
all faults that \fBfsck.ocfs2\fR finds but will not give the operator a chance to intervene if \fBfsck.ocfs2\fR decides that it wants to drastically repair the file system.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR 
This option causes \fBfsck.ocfs2\fR to produce a very large amount of debugging output.

.TP
\fB\-V\fR 
Print version information and exit.

.SH EXIT CODE
The exit code returned by \fBfsck.ocfs2\fR is the sum of the following conditions:
.br
\	0\	\-\ No errors
.br
\	1\	\-\ File system errors corrected
.br
\	2\	\-\ File system errors corrected, system should
.br
\	\	\ \ be rebooted
.br
\	4\	\-\ File system errors left uncorrected
.br
\	8\	\-\ Operational error
.br
\	16\	\-\ Usage or syntax error
.br
\	32\	\-\ E2fsck canceled by user request
.br
\	128\	\-\ Shared library error
.br
