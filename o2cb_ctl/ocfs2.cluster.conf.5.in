.SH "NAME"
/etc/ocfs2/cluster.conf \- Cluster configuration file for the \fBo2cb\fR cluster stack.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
The cluster layout of the \fBo2cb\fR cluster stack is specified in \fI/etc/ocfs2/cluster.conf\fR.
It lists the name of the cluster, the nodes comprising that cluster and its heartbeat regions.
The cluster stack expects this file to be the same on all nodes in that cluster.

This file should be populated using the \fBo2cb(8)\fR cluster configuration utility. A sample
of the same is shown in the example section.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The configuration file is divided into three types of stanzas, each with a list of parameters
and values. The three stanza types are \fIcluster\fR, \fInode\fR and \fIheartbeat\fR. While a
configuration file can store definitions of multiple clusters, the \fBo2cb\fR cluster stack
allows only one cluster to be active at any one time. The name of this active cluster is stored
in /etc/sysconfig/o2cb [\fBo2cb.sysconfig(5)\fR].

The \fBcluster stanza\fR specifies the name of the cluster, number of nodes and the heartbeat mode.
The cluster name can include up to 16 alphanumeric characters [0-9A-Za-z]. No special characters
are allowed.

.TS
CENTER ALLBOX;
LB LB
LB L.
Parameters	Description
node_count	Number of nodes in the cluster
heartbeat_mode	\fBlocal\fR or \fBglobal\fR heartbeat
name	Cluster name (up to 16 alphanumeric chars [0-9A-Za-z])
.TE
.BR

The \fBnode stanza\fR specifies the node name that is part of the cluster alongwith its
IPv4 address, port and node number.  The node name must match the hostname. The domain
name is not required. For example, appserver1.company.com can be appserver1. The IPv4
address need not be the one associated with that hostname. As in, any valid IPv4 address
on that node can be used. The \fBo2cb\fR cluster stack will not attempt to match the
node name (hostname) with the specified IPv4 address. A low-latency private interconnect
address is recommended for best performance.

.TS
CENTER ALLBOX;
LB LB
LB L.
Parameters	Description
ip_port	IPv4 port
ip_address	IPv4 address (private interconnect recommended)
number	Node number (0 - 254)
name	Node name (\fIhostname\fR without the domain name)
cluster	Cluster name (should match the name in the cluster stanza)
.TE
.BR

The \fBheartbeat stanza\fR specifies the global heartbeat region UUIDs. A cluster can have
up to 32 heartbeat regions. This is an optional stanza and is only required if the global
heartbeat mode is enabled. In other words, the regions are only used if \fBheartbeat_mode = global\fR
is in the \fIcluster\fR stanza. If not, this stanza is ignored.

.TS
CENTER ALLBOX;
LB LB
LB L.
Parameters	Description
region	Heartbeat region UUID
cluster	Cluster name (should match the name in the cluster stanza)
.TE
.BR

While manual editing is not recommended, users doing so must follow the format strictly.
The stanza should start at the first column and end with a colon. The parameters
must start after a tab. A blank line must demarcate each stanza. Care should be taken
to avoid stray white-spaces.

.SH "EXAMPLE"
The example below illustrates populating a cluster.conf with a cluster called webcluster,
having 3 nodes and 3 global heartbeat regions, using the \fBo2cb(8)\fR utility.
