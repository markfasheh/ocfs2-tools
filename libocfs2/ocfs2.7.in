.SH "NAME"
OCFS2 \- A Cluster file system for Linux

.SH "INTRODUCTION"
.PP

\fBOCFS2\fR is a \fBfile system\fR. It allows users to store and retrieve data. The data
is stored in files that are organized in a hierarchical directory tree. It is a \fBPOSIX compliant\fR
file system that supports the standard interfaces and the behavioral semantics as spelled out
by that specification.

It is also a \fBshared disk cluster\fR file system, one that allows multiple nodes to access the
same disk at the same time. This is where the fun begins as allowing a file system to be
accessible on multiple nodes opens a can of worms. What if the nodes are of different
architectures? What if a node dies while writing to the file system? What data consistency
can one expect if processes on two nodes are reading and writing concurrently? What if
one node removes a file while it is still being used on another node?

Unlike most shared file systems where the answer is fuzzy, the answer in OCFS2 is very
well defined. It behaves on all nodes exactly like a \fBlocal\fR file system. If a file is
removed, the directory entry is removed but the inode is kept as long as it is in use across
the cluster. When the last user closes the descriptor, the inode is marked for deletion.

The data consistency model follows the same principle. It works as if the two processes
that are running on two different nodes are running on the same node. A read on a node
gets the last write irrespective of the IO mode used. The modes can be \fIbuffered\fR, \fIdirect\fR,
\fIasynchronous\fR, \fIsplice\fR or \fImemory mapped\fR IOs. It is fully \fBcache coherent\fR.

Take for example the REFLINK feature that allows a user to create multiple write-able
snapshots of a file. This feature, like all others, is fully cluster-aware. A file
being written to on multiple nodes can be safely reflinked on another. The snapshot
created is a point-in-time image of the file that includes both the file data and all its
attributes (including extended attributes).

It is a \fBjournaling\fR file system. When a node dies, a surviving node transparently replays
the journal of the dead node. This ensures that the file system metadata is always
consistent. It also defaults to ordered data journaling to ensure the file data is flushed
to disk before the journal commit, to remove the small possibility of stale data appearing
in files after a crash.

It is \fBarchitecture\fR and \fBendian neutral\fR. It allows concurrent mounts on nodes with
different processors like x86, x86_64, IA64 and PPC64. It handles little and big endian,
32-bit and 64-bit architectures.

It is \fBfeature rich\fR. It supports \fIindexed directories\fR, \fImetadata checksums\fR,
\fIextended attributes\fR, \fIPOSIX ACLs\fR, \fIquotas\fR, \fIREFLINKs\fR, \fIsparse files\fR,
\fIunwritten extents\fR and \fIinline-data\fR.

It is \fBfully integrated\fR with the mainline Linux kernel. The file system was merged
into Linux kernel 2.6.16 in early 2006.

It is \fBquickly installed\fR. It is available with almost all Linux distributions.
The file system is \fBon-disk compatible\fR across all of them.

It is \fBmodular\fR. The file system can be configured to operate with other cluster
stacks like \fIPacemaker\fR and \fICMAN\fR along with its own stack, \fIO2CB\fR.

It is \fBeasily configured\fR. The O2CB cluster stack configuration involves editing two
files, one for cluster layout and the other for cluster timeouts.

It is \fBvery efficient\fR. The file system consumes very little resources. It is used
to store virtual machine images in limited memory environments like Xen and KVM.

In summary, OCFS2 is an efficient, easily configured, modular, quickly installed, fully
integrated and compatible, feature-rich, architecture and endian neutral, cache coherent,
ordered data journaling, POSIX-compliant, shared disk cluster file system.

.SH "OVERVIEW"
.PP

OCFS2 is a general-purpose shared-disk cluster file system for Linux capable of providing
both high performance and high availability.

As it provides local file system semantics, it can be used with almost all applications.
Cluster-aware applications can make use of cache-coherent parallel I/Os from multiple nodes
to scale out applications easily. Other applications can make use of the clustering
facilities to fail-over running application in the event of a node failure.

The notable features of the file system are:
.TP
\fBTunable Block size\fR
The file system supports block sizes of 512, 1K, 2K and 4K bytes. 4KB is almost always
recommended. This feature is available in all releases of the file system.

.TP
\fBTunable Cluster size\fR
A cluster size is also referred to as an allocation unit. The file system supports
cluster sizes of 4K, 8K, 16K, 32K, 64K, 128K, 256K, 512K and 1M bytes. For most use
cases, 4KB is recommended. However, a larger value is recommended for volumes hosting
mostly very large files like database files, virtual machine images, etc. A large
cluster size allows the file system to store large files more efficiently. This feature
is available in all releases of the file system.

.TP
\fBEndian and Architecture neutral\fR
The file system can be mounted concurrently on nodes having different architectures.
Like 32-bit, 64-bit, little-endian (x86, x86_64, ia64) and big-endian (ppc64, s390x).
This feature is available in all releases of the file system.

.TP
\fBBuffered, Direct, Asynchronous, Splice and Memory Mapped I/O modes\fR
The file system supports all modes of I/O for maximum flexibility and performance.
It also supports cluster-wide \fBshared writeable mmap(2)\fR. The support for bufferred,
direct and asynchronous I/O is available in all releases. The support for splice I/O
was added in Linux kernel \fB2.6.20\fR and for shared writeable map(2) in \fB2.6.23\fR.

.TP
\fBMultiple Cluster Stacks\fR
The file system includes a flexible framework to allow it to function with userspace
cluster stacks like Pacemaker (\fBpcmk\fR) and CMAN (\fBcman\fR), its own in-kernel
cluster stack \fBo2cb\fR and \fIno\fR cluster stack.

The support for \fBo2cb\fR cluster stack is available in all releases.

The support for \fIno\fR cluster stack, or \fBlocal\fR mount, was added in Linux
kernel \fB2.6.20\fR.

The support for userspace cluster stack was added in Linux kernel \fB2.6.26\fR.

.TP
\fBJournaling\fR
The file system supports both \fBordered\fR (default) and \fBwriteback\fR data journaling
modes to provide file system consistency in the event of power failure or system crash.
It uses \fBJBD2\fR in Linux kernel \fB2.6.28\fR and later. It used \fBJBD\fR in earlier
kernels.

.TP
\fBExtent-based Allocations\fR
The file system allocates and tracks space in ranges of clusters. This is unlike block
based file systems that have to track each and every block. This feature allows the
file system to be very efficient when dealing with both large volumes and large files.
This feature is available in all releases of the file system.

.TP
\fBSparse files\fR
Sparse files are files with holes. With this feature, the file system delays allocating
space until a write is issued to a cluster. This feature was added in Linux kernel \fB2.6.22\fR
and requires enabling on-disk feature \fBsparse\fR.

.TP
\fBUnwritten Extents\fR
An unwritten extent is also referred to as user pre-allocation. It allows an application
to request a range of clusters to be allocated, but not initialized, within a file.
Pre-allocation allows the file system to optimize the data layout with fewer, larger
extents. It also provides a performance boost, delaying initialization until the user
writes to the clusters. This feature was added in Linux kernel \fB2.6.23\fR and requires
enabling on-disk feature \fBunwritten\fR.

.TP
\fBHole Punching\fR
Hole punching allows an application to remove arbitrary allocated regions within a
file. Creating holes, essentially. This is more efficient than zeroing the same extents.
This feature is especially useful in virtualized environments as it allows a block discard
in a guest file system to be converted to a hole punch in the host file system thus
allowing users to reduce disk space usage. This feature was added in Linux kernel \fB2.6.23\fR
and requires enabling on-disk features \fBsparse\fR and \fBunwritten\fR.

.TP
\fBInline-data\fR
Inline data is also referred to as data-in-inode as it allows storing small files
and directories in the inode block. This not only saves space but also has a positive
impact on cold-cache directory and file operations. The data is transparently moved
out to an extent when it no longer fits inside the inode block. This feature was added
in Linux kernel \fB2.6.24\fR and requires enabling on-disk feature \fBinline-data\fR.

.TP
\fBREFLINK\fR
REFLINK is also referred to as fast copy. It allows users to atomically (and instantly)
copy regular files. In other words, create multiple writeable snapshots of regular files.
It is called REFLINK because it looks and feels more like a (hard) \fBlink(2)\fR than a
traditional snapshot. Like a link, it is a regular user operation, subject to the security
attributes of the inode being reflinked and not to the super user privileges typically
required to create a snapshot. Like a link, it operates within a file system. But unlike
a link, it links the inodes at the data extent level allowing each reflinked inode to grow
independently as and when written to. Up to four billion inodes can share a data extent.
This feature was added in Linux kernel \fB2.6.32\fR and requires enabling on-disk feature
\fBrefcount\fR.

.TP
\fBAllocation Reservation\fR
File contiguity plays an important role in file system performance. When a file is
fragmented on disk, reading and writing to the file involves many seeks, leading to
lower throughput. Contiguous files, on the other hand, minimize seeks, allowing the
disks to perform IO at the maximum rate.

With allocation reservation, the file system reserves a window in the bitmap for all
extending files allowing each to grow as contiguously as possible. As this extra space
is not actually allocated, it is available for use by other files if the need arises.
This feature was added in Linux kernel \fB2.6.35\fR and can be tuned using the mount
option \fBresv_level\fR.

.TP
\fBIndexed Directories\fR
An indexed directory allows users to perform quick lookups of a file in very large
directories. It also results in faster creates and unlinks and thus provides better
overall performance. This feature was added in Linux kernel \fB2.6.30\fR and requires
enabling on-disk feature \fBindexed-dirs\fR.

.TP
\fBFile Attributes\fR
This refers to EXT2-style file attributes, such as immutable, modified using
\fBchattr(1)\fR and queried using \fBlsattr(1)\fR. This feature was added in Linux
kernel \fB2.6.19\fR.

.TP
\fBExtended Attributes\fR
An extended attribute refers to a name:value pair than can be associated with file
system objects like regular files, directories, symbolic links, etc. \fIOCFS2\fR allows
associating an \fIunlimited\fR number of attributes per object. The attribute names can be
up to 255 bytes in length, terminated by the first NUL character. While it is not
required, printable names (ASCII) are recommended. The attribute values can be up
to 64 KB of arbitrary binary data. These attributes can be modified and listed using
standard Linux utilities \fBsetfattr(1)\fR and \fBgetfattr(1)\fR. This feature was
added in Linux kernel \fB2.6.29\fR and requires enabling on-disk feature \fBxattr\fR.

.TP
\fBMetadata Checksums\fR
This feature allows the file system to detect silent corruptions in all metadata blocks
like inodes and directories. This feature was added in Linux kernel \fB2.6.29\fR and
requires enabling on-disk feature \fBmetaecc\fR.

.TP
\fBPOSIX ACLs and Security Attributes\fR
POSIX ACLs allows assigning fine-grained discretionary access rights for files and
directories. This security scheme is a lot more flexible than the traditional file
access permissions that imposes a strict user-group-other model.

Security attributes allow the file system to support other security regimes like SELinux,
SMACK, AppArmor, etc.

Both these security extensions were added in Linux kernel \fB2.6.29\fR and requires
enabling on-disk feature \fBxattr\fR.

.TP
\fBUser and Group Quotas\fR
This feature allows setting up usage quotas on user and group basis by using the
standard utilities like \fBquota(1)\fR, \fBsetquota(8)\fR, \fBquotacheck(8)\fR, and
\fBquotaon(8)\fR. This feature was added in Linux kernel \fB2.6.29\fR and requires
enabling on-disk features \fBusrquota\fR and \fBgrpquota\fR.

.TP
\fBUnix File Locking\fR
The Unix operating system has historically provided two system calls to lock files.
\fBflock(2)\fR or BSD locking and \fBfcntl(2)\fR or POSIX locking. \fIOCFS2\fR
extends both file locks to the cluster. File locks taken on one node interact with those
taken on other nodes.

The support for clustered \fBflock(2)\fR was added in Linux kernel \fB2.6.26\fR.
All \fBflock(2)\fR options are supported, including the kernels ability to cancel
a lock request when an appropriate kill signal is received by the user. This feature
is supported with all cluster-stacks including \fBo2cb\fR.

The support for clustered \fBfcntl(2)\fR was added in Linux kernel \fB2.6.28\fR.
But because it requires group communication to make the locks coherent, it is only
supported with userspace cluster stacks, \fBpcmk\fR and \fBcman\fR and \fInot\fR
with the default cluster stack \fBo2cb\fR.

.TP
\fBComprehensive Tools Support\fR
The file system has a comprehensive EXT3-style toolset that tries to use similar
parameters for ease-of-use. It includes mkfs.ocfs2(8) (format), tunefs.ocfs2(8)
(tune), fsck.ocfs2(8) (check), debugfs.ocfs2(8) (debug), etc.

.TP
\fBOnline Resize\fR
The file system can be dynamically grown using \fBtunefs.ocfs2(8)\fR. This feature
was added in Linux kernel \fB2.6.25\fR.

.SH "RECENT CHANGES"
.PP

The O2CB cluster stack has a \fBglobal heartbeat\fR mode. It allows users to specify
heartbeat regions that are consistent across all nodes. The cluster stack also allows
online addition and removal of both nodes and heartbeat regions.

\fBo2cb(8)\fR is the new cluster configuration utility. It is an easy to use utility
that allows users to create the cluster configuration on a node that is not part of the
cluster. It replaces the older utility \fBo2cb_ctl(8)\fR which has being deprecated.

\fBocfs2console(8)\fR has been obsoleted.

\fBo2info(8)\fR is a new utility that can be used to provide file system information.
It allows non-priviledged users to see the enabled file system features, block and
cluster sizes, extended file stat, free space fragmentation, etc.

\fBo2hbmonitor(8)\fR is a \fBo2hb\fR heartbeat monitor. It is an extremely light weight
utility that logs messages to the system logger once the heartbeat delay exceeds the
warn threshold. This utility is useful in identifying volumes encountering I/O delays.

\fBdebugfs.ocfs2(8)\fR has some new commands. \fInet_stats\fR shows the \fBo2net\fR
message times between various nodes. This is useful in indentifying nodes are that slowing
down the cluster operations. \fIstat_sysdir\fR allows the user to dump the entire system
directory that can be used to debug issues. \fIgrpextents\fR dumps the complete free space
fragmentation in the cluster group allocator.

\fBmkfs.ocfs2(8)\fR now enables \fIxattr\fB, \fIindexed-dirs\fR, \fIdiscontig-bg\fR,
\fIrefcount\fR, \fIextended-slotmap\fR and \fIclusterinfo\fR feature flags by default,
in addition to the older defaults, \fIsparse\fR, \fIunwritten\fR and \fIinline-data\fR.

\fBmount.ocfs2(8)\fR allows users to specify the level of cache coherency between nodes.
By default the file system operates in full coherency mode that also serializes the
direct I/Os. While this mode is technically correct, it limits the I/O thruput in a
clustered database. This mount option allows the user to limit the cache coherency
to only the buffered I/Os to allow multiple nodes to do concurrent direct writes to
the same file. This feature works with Linux kernel \fB2.6.37\fR and later.

.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP

The OCFS2 development teams goes to great lengths to maintain compatibility. It attempts
to maintain both on-disk and network protocol compatibility across all releases of the
file system. It does so even while adding new features that entail on-disk format and
network protocol changes. To do this successfully, it follows a few rules:

.in +4n
\fB1\fR. The on-disk format changes are managed by a set of feature flags that can be
turned on and off. The file system in kernel detects these features during mount and
continues only if it understands all the features. Users encountering this have the
option of either disabling that feature or upgrading the file system to a newer release.

\fB2\fR. The latest release of ocfs2-tools is compatible with all versions of the file
system. All utilities detect the features enabled on disk and continue only if it
understands all the features. Users encountering this have to upgrade the tools to
a newer release.

\fB3\fR. The network protocol version is negotiated by the nodes to ensure all nodes
understand the active protocol version.
.in

.TP
\fBFEATURE FLAGS\fR
The feature flags are split into three categories, namely, \fBCompat\fR, \fBIncompat\fR
and \fBRO Compat\fR.

\fBCompat\fR, or compatible, is a feature that the file system does not need to fully
understand to safely read/write to the volume. An example of this is the backup-super
feature that added the capability to backup the super block in multiple locations in the
file system. As the backup super blocks are typically not read nor written to by the file
system, an older file system can safely mount a volume with this feature enabled.

\fBIncompat\fR, or incompatible, is a feature that the file system needs to fully
understand to read/write to the volume. Most features fall under this category.

\fBRO Compat\fR, or read-only compatible, is a feature that the file system needs to
fully understand to write to the volume. Older software can safely read a volume with
this feature enabled. An example of this would be user and group quotas. As quotas are
manipulated only when the file system is written to, older software can safely mount
such volumes in read-only mode.

The list of feature flags, the version of the kernel it was added in, the earliest
version of the tools that understands it, etc., is as follows:

.TP
\fBENABLING AND DISABLING FEATURES\fR

The format utility, \fBmkfs.ocfs2(8)\fR, allows a user to enable and disable specific
features using the fs-features option. The features are provided as a comma separated
list. The enabled features are listed as is. The disabled features are prefixed with
\fBno\fR.  The example below shows the file system being formatted with sparse disabled
and inline-data enabled.

.nf
.ft 6
# mkfs.ocfs2 --fs-features=nosparse,inline-data /dev/sda1
.ft
.fi

After formatting, the users can toggle features using the tune utility, \fBtunefs.ocfs2(8)\fR.
This is an \fIoffline\fR operation. The volume needs to be umounted across the cluster.
The example below shows the sparse feature being enabled and inline-data disabled.

.nf
.ft 6
# tunefs.ocfs2 --fs-features=sparse,noinline-data /dev/sda1
.ft
.fi

Care should be taken before enabling and disabling features. Users planning to use a
volume with an older version of the file system will be better of not enabling newer
features as turning disabling may not succeed.

An example would be disabling the sparse feature; this requires filling every hole.
The operation can only succeed if the file system has enough free space.

.TP
\fBDETECTING FEATURE INCOMPATIBILITY\fR

Say one tries to mount a volume with an incompatible feature. What happens then? How
does one detect the problem? How does one know the name of that incompatible feature?

To begin with, one should look for error messages in \fBdmesg(8)\fR. Mount failures that
are due to an incompatible feature will always result in an error message like the following:

.nf
.ps 9
.ft 6
ERROR: couldn't mount because of unsupported optional features (200).
.ft
.ps
.fi

Here the file system is unable to mount the volume due to an unsupported optional
feature. That means that that feature is an \fBIncompat\fR feature. By referring to the
table above, one can then deduce that the user failed to mount a volume with the \fBxattr\fR
feature enabled. (The value in the error message is in hexadecimal.)

Another example of an error message due to incompatibility is as follows:

.nf
.ps 9
.ft 6
ERROR: couldn't mount RDWR because of unsupported optional features (1).
.ft
.ps
.fi

Here the file system is unable to mount the volume in the RW mode. That means that
that feature is a \fBRO Compat\fR feature. Another look at the table and it becomes
apparent that the volume had the \fBunwritten\fR feature enabled.

In both cases, the user has the option of disabling the feature. In the second case,
the user has the choice of mounting the volume in the RO mode.

.SH "GETTING STARTED"
.PP

The OCFS2 software is split into two components, namely, kernel and tools. The kernel
component includes the core file system and the cluster stack, and is packaged along
with the kernel. The tools component is packaged as \fBocfs2-tools\fR and needs to
be specifically installed. It provides utilities to format, tune, mount, debug and
check the file system.

To install \fBocfs2-tools\fR, refer to the package handling utility in in your distributions.

The next step is selecting a cluster stack. The options include:

.in +4n
\fBA\fR. No cluster stack, or \fBlocal mount\fR.

\fBB\fR. In-kernel \fBo2cb\fR cluster stack with \fBlocal\fR or \fBglobal\fR heartbeat.

\fBC\fR. Userspace cluster stacks \fBpcmk\fR or \fBcman\fR.
.in

The file system allows changing cluster stacks easily using \fBtunefs.ocfs2(8)\fR.
To list the cluster stacks stamped on the OCFS2 volumes, do:

.nf
.ps 9
.ft 6
# mounted.ocfs2 -d

.ft
.ps
.fi

.TP
\fBNON-CLUSTERED OR LOCAL MOUNT\fR

To format a \fIOCFS2\fR volume as a non-clustered (\fBlocal\fR) volume, do:

.nf
.ft 6
# mkfs.ocfs2 -L "mylabel" --fs-features=local /dev/sda1
.ft
.fi

To convert an existing clustered volume to a non-clustered volume, do:

.nf
.ft 6
# tunefs.ocfs2 --fs-features=local /dev/sda1
.ft
.fi

Non-clustered volumes do not interact with the cluster stack. One can have both
clustered and non-clustered volumes mounted at the same time.

While formating a non-clustered volume, users should consider the possibility of later
converting that volume to a clustered one. If there is a possibility of that, then the
user should add enough node-slots using the -N option. Adding node-slots during format
creates journals with large extents. If created later, then the journals will be
fragmented which is not good for performance.

.TP
\fBCLUSTERED MOUNT WITH O2CB CLUSTER STACK\fR

Only one of the two heartbeat mode can be active at any one time. Changing heartbeat
modes is an offline operation.

Both heartbeat modes require /etc/ocfs2/cluster.conf and /etc/sysconfig/o2cb to
be populated as described in \fBocfs2.cluster.conf(5)\fR and \fBo2cb.sysconfig(5)\fR
respectively. The only difference in set up between the two modes is that \fBglobal\fR
requires heartbeat devices to be configured whereas \fBlocal\fR does not.

Refer \fBo2cb(7)\fR for more information.

.RS
.TP
\fBLOCAL HEARTBEAT\fR
This is the default heartbeat mode. The user needs to populate the configuration files
as described in \fBocfs2.cluster.conf(5)\fR and \fBo2cb.sysconfig(5)\fR. In this mode,
the cluster stack heartbeats on all mounted volumes. Thus, one does not have to specify
heartbeat devices in cluster.conf.

Once configured, the \fBo2cb\fR cluster stack can be onlined and offlined as follows:

.nf
.ft 6
# service o2cb online
Setting cluster stack "o2cb": OK
Registering O2CB cluster "webcluster": OK
Setting O2CB cluster timeouts : OK

# service o2cb offline
Clean userdlm domains: OK
Stopping O2CB cluster webcluster: OK
Unregistering O2CB cluster "webcluster": OK
.ft
.fi

.TP
\fBGLOBAL HEARTBEAT\fR
The configuration is similar to \fBlocal\fR heartbeat. The one additional step in
this mode is that it requires heartbeat devices to be also configured.

These heartbeat devices are OCFS2 formatted volumes with global heartbeat enabled
on disk. These volumes can later be mounted and used as clustered file systems.

The steps to format a volume with global heartbeat enabled is listed in \fBo2cb(7)\fR.
Also listed there is listing all volumes with the cluster stack stamped on disk.

In this mode, the heartbeat is started when the cluster is onlined and stopped when
the cluster is offlined.

.SH "FILE SYSTEM UTILITIES"
.PP

This sections lists the utilities that are used to manage the \fIOCFS2\fR file systems.
This includes tools to format, tune, check, mount, debug the file system. Each utility
has a man page that lists its capabilities in detail.

.TP
\fBmkfs.ocfs2(8)\fR
This is the file system \fIformat\fR utility. All volumes have to be formatted prior to
its use.  As this utility overwrites the volume, use it with care. Double check to ensure
the volume is not in use on any node in the cluster.

As a precaution, the utility will abort if the volume is locally mounted. It also
detects use across the cluster if used by OCFS2. But these checks are not comprehensive
and can be overridden. So use it with care.

While it is not always required, the cluster should be online.

.TP
\fBtunefs.ocfs2(8)\fR
This is the file system \fItune\fR utility. It allows users to change certain on-disk
parameters like label, uuid, number of node-slots, volume size and the size of the
journals. It also allows turning on and off the file system features as listed above.

This utility requires the cluster to be online.

.TP
\fBfsck.ocfs2(8)\fR
This is the file system \fIcheck\fR utility. It detects and fixes on-disk errors. All the
check codes and their fixes are listed in \fBfsck.ocfs2.checks(8)\fR.

This utility requires the cluster to be online to ensure the volume is not in use on
another node and to prevent the volume from being mounted for the duration of the check.

.TP
\fBmount.ocfs2(8)\fR
This is the file system \fImount\fR utility. It is invoked indirectly by the \fBmount(8)\fR
utility.

This utility detects the cluster status and aborts if the cluster is offline or does
not match the cluster stamped on disk.

.TP
\fBo2info(1)\fR
This is the file system \fIinformation\fR utility. It provides information like the features
enabled on disk, block size, cluster size, free space fragmentation, etc.

It can be used by both priviledged and non-priviledged users. Users having read permission
on the device can provide the path to the device. Other users can provide the path to a
file on a mounted file system.

.TP
\fBdebugfs.ocfs2(8)\fR
This is the file system \fIdebug\fR utility. It allows users to examine all file system
structures including walking directory structures, displaying inodes, backing up files,
etc., without mounting the file system.

This utility requires the user to have read permission on the device.

.TP
\fBo2image(8)\fR
This is the file system \fIimage\fR utility. It allows users to copy the file system metadata
skeleton, including the inodes, directories, bitmaps, etc. As it excludes data, it
shrinks the size of the file system tremendously.

The image file created can be used in debugging on-disk corruptions.

.TP
\fBmounted.ocfs2(8)\fR
This is the file system \fIdetect\fR utility. It detects all \fIOCFS2\fR volumes in the
system and lists its label, uuid and cluster stack. 

.SH "O2CB CLUSTER STACK UTILITIES"

\fBo2cb(8)\fR
This is the cluster \fIconfiguration\fR utility. It allows users to update the cluster
configuration by adding and removing nodes and heartbeat regions. This utility is used
by the \fIo2cb\fR init script to online and offline the cluster.

This is a \fBnew\fR utility and replaces \fBo2cb_ctl(8)\fR which has been deprecated.

.TP
\fBocfs2_hb_ctl(8)\fR
This is the cluster heartbeat utility. It allows users to start and stop \fBlocal\fR
heartbeat. This utility is invoked by \fBmount.ocfs2(8)\fR and should not be invoked
directly by the user.

\fBBALANCED CLUSTER\fR
A cluster is a computer. This is a fact and not a slogan. What this means is that an errant
node in the cluster can affect the behavior of other nodes. If one node is slow, the cluster
operations will slow down on all nodes. To prevent that, it is best to have a balanced
cluster. This is a cluster that has equally powered and loaded nodes.

The standard recommendation for such clusters is to have identical hardware and
software across all the nodes. However, that is not a hard and fast rule. After all,
we have taken the effort to ensure that OCFS2 works in a mixed architecture environment.

If one uses OCFS2 in a mixed architecture environment, try to ensure that the nodes are
equally powered and loaded. The use of a load balancer can assist with the latter. Power
refers to the number of processors, speed, amount of memory, I/O throughput, network
bandwidth, etc. In reality, having equally powered heterogeneous nodes is not always
practical. In that case, make the lower node numbers more powerful than the higher
node numbers. The O2CB cluster stack favors lower node numbers in all of its tiebreaking logic.

This is not to suggest you should add a single core node in a cluster of quad cores. No
amount of node number juggling will help you there.

.TP
\fBFILE DELETION\fR
In Linux, rm(1) removes the directory entry. It does not necessarily delete the corresponding
inode. By removing the directory entry, it gives the illusion that the inode has been deleted.
This puzzles users when they do not see a corresponding up-tick in the reported free space.
The reason is that inode deletion has a few more hurdles to cross.

First is the hard link count. This indicates the number of directory entries pointing to that
inode. As long as a directory entry is linked to that inode, it cannot be deleted. The file
system has to wait for that count to drop to zero.

The second hurdle is the POSIX semantics allowing files to be unlinked even while they are
in use. In OCFS2, that translates to in use across the cluster. The file system has to wait
for all processes across the cluster to stop using the inode.

Once these two conditions are met, the inode is deleted and the freed bits are flushed to
disk on the next sync.

This assumes that the inode was not reflinked. If it was, then the deletion would only
release space that was private to the inode. Shared space would only be released when
the last inode using it is deleted.

Users interested in following the trail can use debugfs.ocfs2(8) to view the node specific
system files orphan_dir and truncate_log. Once the link count is zero, an inode is moved
to the orphan_dir. After deletion, the freed bits are added to the truncate_log, where
they remain until the next sync, during which the bits are flushed to the global bitmap.

.TP
\fBDIRECTORY LISTING\fR
ls(1) may be a simple command, but it is not cheap. What is expensive is not the part
where it reads the directory listing, but the second part where it reads all the inodes, also
referred as an inode stat(2). If the inodes are not in cache, this can entail disk I/O.
Now, while a cold cache inode stat(2) is expensive in all file systems, it is especially so in
a clustered file system. It needs to take a lock on each node, pure overhead when
compared to a local file system.

A hot cache stat(2), on the other hand, has shown to perform on OCFS2 like it does on
EXT3.

In other words, the second ls(1) will be quicker than the first. However, it is not
guaranteed. Say you have a million files in a file system and not enough kernel memory
to cache all the inodes. In that case, each ls(1) will involve some cold cache stat(2)s.

.TP
\fBALLOCATION RESERVATION\fR
Allocation reservation allows multiple concurrently extending files to grow as contiguously
as possible. One way to demonstrate its functioning is to run a script that extends
multiple files in a circular order. The script below does that by writing one hundred
4KB chunks to four files, one after another.

.nf
.ft 6
$ for i in $(seq 0 99);
> do
>   for j in $(seq 4);
>   do
>     dd if=/dev/zero of=file$j bs=4K count=1 seek=$i;
>   done;
> done;
.ft
.fi

When run on a system running Linux kernel 2.6.34 or earlier, we end up with files with
100 extents each. That is full fragmentation. As the files are being extended one after
another, the on-disk allocations are fully interleaved.

.nf
.ft 6
$ filefrag file1 file2 file3 file4
file1: 100 extents found
file2: 100 extents found
file3: 100 extents found
file4: 100 extents found
.ft
.fi

When run on a system running Linux kernel 2.6.35 or later, we see files with 7 extents
each. That is a lot fewer than before. Fewer extents mean more on-disk contiguity and
that always leads to better overall performance.

.nf
.ft 6
$ filefrag file1 file2 file3 file4
file1: 7 extents found
file2: 7 extents found
file3: 7 extents found
file4: 7 extents found
.ft

.TP
\fBREFLINK OPERATION\fR
This feature allows a user to create a writeable snapshot of a regular file. In this
operation, the file system creates a new inode with the same extent pointers as the
original inode. Multiple inodes are thus able to share data extents. This adds a twist
in file system administration because none of the existing file system utilities in
Linux expect this behavior. du(1), a utility to used to compute file space usage,
simply adds the blocks allocated to each inode. As it does not know about shared
extents, it over estimates the space used.  Say, we have a 5GB file in a volume having
42GB free.

.nf
.ft 6

.ft
.fi

If we were to reflink it 4 times, we would expect the directory listing to report five 5GB
files, but the df(1) to report no loss of available space. du(1), on the other hand, would
report the disk usage to climb to 25GB.

\fBDATA COHERENCY\fR
One of the challenges in a shared file system is data coherency when multiple nodes are
writing to the same set of files. NFS, for example, provides close-to-open data coherency
that results in the data being flushed to the server when the file is closed on the client.
This leaves open a wide window for stale data being read on another node.

A simple test to check the data coherency of a shared file system involves concurrently
appending the same file. Like running "uname -a >>/dir/file" using a parallel distributed
shell like dsh or pconsole. If coherent, the file will contain the results from all nodes.

OCFS2 is a \fBfully cache coherent\fR cluster file system.

.TP
\fBDISCONTIGUOUS BLOCK GROUP\fR
Most file systems pre-allocate space for inodes during format. OCFS2 dynamically
allocates this space when required.

However, this dynamic allocation has been problematic when the free space is very
fragmented, because the file system required the inode and extent allocators to
grow in contiguous fixed-size chunks.

The discontiguous block group feature takes care of this problem by allowing the
allocators to grow in smaller, variable-sized chunks.

This feature was added in Linux kernel \fB2.6.35\fR and requires enabling on-disk
feature \fBdiscontig-bg\fR.

.TP
\fBBACKUP SUPER BLOCKS\fR
A file system super block stores critical information that is hard to recreate.
In OCFS2, it stores the block size, cluster size, and the locations of the root and
system directories, among other things. As this block is close to the start of the
disk, it is very susceptible to being overwritten by an errant write.
Say, dd if=file of=/dev/sda1.

Backup super blocks are copies of the super block. These blocks are dispersed in the
volume to minimize the chances of being overwritten. On the small chance that the
original gets corrupted, the backups are available to scan and fix the corruption.

\fBmkfs.ocfs2(8)\fR enables this feature by default. Users can disable this by
specifying \fB--fs-features=nobackup-super\fR during format.

\fBo2info(1)\fR can be used to view whether the feature has been enabled on a device.

.nf

In OCFS2, the super block is on the third block. The backups are located at the \fB1G,
4G, 16G, 64G, 256G and 1T\fB byte offsets. The actual number of backup blocks depends
on the size of the device. The super block is not backed up on devices smaller than 1GB.

\fBfsck.ocfs2(8)\fR refers to these six offsets by numbers, 1 to 6. Users can specify
any backup with the -r option to recover the volume. The example below uses the second
backup. If successful, \fBfsck.ocfs2(8)\fR overwrites the corrupted super block with
the backup.

\fBSYNTHETIC FILE SYSTEMS\fR
The OCFS2 development effort included two synthetic file systems, configfs and dlmfs. It
also makes use of a third, debugfs.

.RS
.TP
\fBconfigfs\fR
configfs has since been accepted as a generic kernel component and is also used by
netconsole and fs/dlm. OCFS2 tools use it to communicate the list of nodes in the
cluster, details of the heartbeat device, cluster timeouts, and so on to the in-kernel
node manager. The o2cb init script mounts this file system at /sys/kernel/config.

.TP
\fBdlmfs\fR
dlmfs exposes the in-kernel o2dlm to the user-space. While it was developed
primarily for OCFS2 tools, it has seen usage by others looking to add a cluster
locking dimension in their applications. Users interested in doing the same should
look at the libo2dlm library provided by ocfs2-tools. The o2cb init script mounts this
file system at /dlm.

.TP
\fBdebugfs\fR
OCFS2 uses debugfs to expose its in-kernel information to user space. For example,
listing the file system cluster locks, dlm locks, dlm state, o2net state, etc. Users can
access the information by mounting the file system at /sys/kernel/debug. To automount,
add the following to /etc/fstab:

.TP
\fBDISTRIBUTED LOCK MANAGER\fR
One of the key technologies in a cluster is the lock manager, which maintains the locking
state of all resources across the cluster. An easy implementation of a lock manager
involves designating one node to handle everything. In this model, if a node wanted to
acquire a lock, it would send the request to the lock manager. However, this model has a
weakness: lock manager’s death causes the cluster to seize up.

A better model is one where all nodes manage a subset of the lock resources. Each node
maintains enough information for all the lock resources it is interested in. On event
of a node death, the remaining nodes pool in the information to reconstruct the lock
state maintained by the dead node. In this scheme, the locking overhead is distributed
amongst all the nodes. Hence, the term distributed lock manager.

O2DLM is a distributed lock manager. It is based on the specification titled "Programming
Locking Application" written by Kristin Thomas and is available at the following link.
http://opendlm.sourceforge.net/cvsmirror/opendlm/docs/dlmbook_final.pdf

\fBDLM DEBUGGING\fR
O2DLM has a rich debugging infrastructure that allows it to show the state of the lock
manager, all the lock resources, among other things.
The figure below shows the dlm state of a nine-node cluster that has just lost three

other live nodes.

At this stage, one should note that the hanging node is waiting to get an AST from the
master. The master, on the other hand, cannot send the AST until the current holder has
down converted that lock, which it will do upon receiving a Blocking AST. However, a
node can only down convert if all the lock holders have stopped using that lock.
After dumping the dlm lock on the master node, identify the current lock holder and
dump both the dlm and fs locks on that node.

The trick here is to see whether the Blocking AST message has been relayed to file
system. If not, the problem is in the dlm layer. If it has, then the most common reason
would be a lock holder, the count for which is maintained in the fs lock.

At this stage, printing the list of process helps.

.nf
.ft 6
$ ps -e -o pid,stat,comm,wchan=WIDE-WCHAN-COLUMN
.ft
.fi

Make a note of all D state processes. At least one of them is responsible for the hang on
the first node.

The challenge then is to figure out why those processes are hanging. Failing that, at
least get enough information (like alt-sysrq t output) for the kernel developers to review.
What to do next depends on where the process is hanging. If it is waiting for the I/O to
complete, the problem could be anywhere in the I/O subsystem, from the block device
layer through the drivers to the disk array. If the hang concerns a user lock (flock(2)),
the problem could be in the user’s application. A possible solution could be to kill the
holder. If the hang is due to tight or fragmented memory, free up some memory by
killing non-essential processes.

The thing to note is that the symptom for the problem was on one node but the cause is
on another. The issue can only be resolved on the node holding the lock. Sometimes, the
best solution will be to reset that node. Once killed, the O2DLM recovery process will
clear all locks owned by the dead node and let the cluster continue to operate. As harsh
as that sounds, at times it is the only solution. The good news is that, by following the
trail, you now have enough information to file a bug and get the real issue resolved.

\fBNFS EXPORTING\fR
OCFS2 volumes can be exported as NFS volumes. This support is limited to NFS version
3, which translates to Linux kernel version 2.4 or later.

If the version of the Linux kernel on the system exporting the volume is older than
\fB2.6.30\fR, then the NFS clients must mount the volumes using the \fInordirplus\fR
mount option. This disables the READDIRPLUS RPC call to workaround a bug in NFSD,
detailed in the following link:

.nf
.ps 9
.ft 6
http://oss.oracle.com/pipermail/ocfs2-announce/2008-June/000025.html
.ft
.ps
.fi

Users running NFS version 2 can export the volume after having disabled subtree checking
(mount option no_subtree_check). Be warned, disabling the check has security implications
(documented in the exports(5) man page) that users must evaluate on their own.

.TP
\fBFILE SYSTEM LIMITS\fR
OCFS2 has no intrinsic limit on the total number of files and directories in the file
system. In general, it is only limited by the size of the device. But there is one limit
imposed by the current filesystem. It can address at most four billion clusters. A file
system with 1MB cluster size can go up to 4PB, while a file system with a 4KB cluster size
can address up to 16TB.

.TP
\fBSYSTEM OBJECTS\fR
The OCFS2 file system stores its internal meta-data, including bitmaps, journals, etc., as
system files. These are grouped in a system directory. These files and directories are not
accessible via the file system interface but can be viewed using the \fBdebugfs.ocfs2(8)\fR
tool.

To list the system directory (referred to as double-slash), do:

.nf
.ps 8
.ft 6

The file names that end with numbers are slot specific and are referred to as node-local
system files. The set of node-local files used by a node can be determined from the slot
map. To list the slot map, do:

.nf

# debugfs.ocfs2 -R "slotmap" /dev/sde1
    Slot#    Node#
        0       32

\fBHEARTBEAT, QUORUM, AND FENCING\fR
Heartbeat is an essential component in any cluster. It is charged with accurately
designating nodes as dead or alive. A mistake here could lead to a cluster hang or a
corruption.

\fIo2hb\fR is the disk heartbeat component of \fBo2cb\fR. It periodically updates a
timestamp on disk, indicating to others that this node is alive. It also reads all the
timestamps to identify other live nodes. Other cluster components, like \fIo2dlm\fR
and \fIo2net\fR, use the \fIo2hb\fR service to get node up and down events.

The quorum is the group of nodes in a cluster that is allowed to operate on the shared
storage. When there is a failure in the cluster, nodes may be split into groups that can
communicate in their groups and with the shared storage but not between groups.
\fIo2quo\fR determines which group is allowed to continue and initiates fencing of
the other group(s).

Fencing is the act of forcefully removing a node from a cluster. A node with OCFS2
mounted will fence itself when it realizes that it does not have quorum in a degraded
cluster. It does this so that other nodes won’t be stuck trying to access its resources.

\fBo2cb\fR uses a machine reset to fence. This is the quickest route for the node to
rejoin the cluster.

.TP
\fBPROCESSES\fR

.RS
.TP
\fB[o2net]\fR
One per node. It is a work-queue thread started when the cluster is brought on-line
and stopped when it is off-lined. It handles network communication for all mounts.
It gets the list of active nodes from O2HB and sets up a TCP/IP communication
channel with each live node. It sends regular keep-alive packets to detect any
interruption on the channels.

.TP
\fB[user_dlm]\fR
One per node. It is a work-queue thread started when dlmfs is loaded and stopped
when it is unloaded (dlmfs is a synthetic file system that allows user space
processes to access the in-kernel dlm).

.TP
\fB[ocfs2_wq]\fR
One per node. It is a work-queue thread started when the OCFS2 module is loaded
and stopped when it is unloaded. It is assigned background file system tasks that
may take cluster locks like flushing the truncate log, orphan directory recovery and
local alloc recovery. For example, orphan directory recovery runs in the background
so that it does not affect recovery time.

.TP
\fB[o2hb-14C29A7392]\fR
One per heartbeat device. It is a kernel thread started when the heartbeat region is
populated in configfs and stopped when it is removed. It writes every two seconds
to a block in the heartbeat region, indicating that this node is alive. It also reads the
region to maintain a map of live nodes. It notifies subscribers like o2net and o2dlm
of any changes in the live node map.

.TP
\fB[ocfs2dc]\fR
One per mount. It is a kernel thread started when a volume is mounted and stopped
when it is unmounted. It downgrades locks in response to blocking ASTs (BASTs)
requested by other nodes.

.TP
\fB[jbd2/sdf1-97]\fR
One per mount. It is part of JBD2, which OCFS2 uses for journaling.

.TP
\fB[ocfs2cmt]\fR
One per mount. It is a kernel thread started when a volume is mounted and stopped
when it is unmounted. It works with kjournald2.

.TP
\fB[ocfs2rec]\fR
It is started whenever a node has to be recovered. This thread performs file system
recovery by replaying the journal of the dead node. It is scheduled to run after dlm
recovery has completed.

.TP
\fB[dlm_thread]\fR
One per dlm domain. It is a kernel thread started when a dlm domain is created and
stopped when it is destroyed. This thread sends ASTs and blocking ASTs in response
to lock level convert requests. It also frees unused lock resources.

.TP
\fB[dlm_reco_thread]\fR
One per dlm domain. It is a kernel thread that handles dlm recovery when another
node dies. If this node is the dlm recovery master, it re-masters every lock resource
owned by the dead node.

.TP
\fB[dlm_wq]\fR
One per dlm domain. It is a work-queue thread that o2dlm uses to queue blocking
tasks.

\fBFUTURE WORK\fR
File system development is a never ending cycle. Faster and larger disks, faster
and more number of processors, larger caches, etc. keep changing the sweet spot for
performance forcing developers to rethink long held beliefs. Add to that new use cases,
which forces developers to be innovative in providing solutions that melds seamlessly
with existing semantics.

We are currently looking to add features like transparent compression, transparent
encryption, delayed allocation, multi-device support, etc. as well as work on improving
performance on newer generation machines.
